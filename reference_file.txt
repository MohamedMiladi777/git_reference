This is a reference list of commands to be used with Git and Github:
* git clone [SSH/HTTPS link]: Clones a repository
* git log : shows history of file changes
* git status : sees the state of the current file
* git add <file_name> : adds the file to the staging area
* git commit -m "message" : "commiting a file"
* git add . : add all files to staging area

The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

For example,

    *git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
    *git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
    *git status is read as git | status | (no destination).
